# C++

C++ is often used for high-performance computing. It's a statically-typed, compiled language created by Bjarne Stroustrup. It's a superset of C, meaning that (in most cases) a C program is also a valid C++ program.

C++ is known for enabling very high performance, but also for its steep learning curve and complex syntax.
