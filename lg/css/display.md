# Display

Display: 
- A `block` element starts on a new line and stretches out to the left and right as far as it can.
- A `inline` element wraps doesn't disrupt the flow. It doesn't begin on a new line and doesn't stretch outside its dimensions.
<!-- todo: other display props -->

Visibility:
element not visible, but still exists in the page flow: is drawn, takes space. To "delete" it, use `display:none;`

```css
x {visibility:hidden;}
```
