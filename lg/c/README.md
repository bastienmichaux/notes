# C

C is a compiled and statically-typed language created in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs and is tied to the development of the Unix operating system.

C is the recommended language for learning computer science, since you need to manage memory yourself working with pointers and addresses.

## About

It remains very widely used. The syntax of C is hugely influential. Many popular languages are part of the "C family": C++, Java, C#, JavaScript, Go, Rust, and many others.

C is still used today for low-level programs, such as hardware drivers, embedded systems, the Linux kernel and a lot of other performance-critical programs. C is rarely used for application programs.
