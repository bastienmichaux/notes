# God Mode

The "God Mode" folder contains more than 200 advanced settings that are sometimes (intentionally?) difficult to find.

To create it:
- create a new folder
- name it `GodMode.{ED7BA470-8E54-465E-825C-99712043E01C}`

For quick access, you can drag-and-drop individual settings on your desktop.
