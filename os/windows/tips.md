# Windows Tips

## Put a file in the start menu

(Windows 10)

Any shortcut to a file you put in here:

`C:\Users\*YourUserName*\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs`

appears in the "All apps" list under the Windows "Start" button on the taskbar. (Note: "AppData" is a hidden folder, so from file explorer, you might want to go to "view" and put a checkbox beside "hidden items" first. Otherwise type the whole string into File Explorer to get to this folder.)

To pin a File:
1. Right-click on the File you want to pin to the Start Screen.
1. Click "Copy".
1. Go to "C:\Users\*YourUserName*\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs".
1. Right-click again in the folder window, then click "Paste shortcut".
1. Go to your "All apps" list under the Start button, and scroll down to find the name of the File you just pasted.
1. Right click on this file from the "Apps list" and click "Pin to start".
