# Web Protocols

The World Wide Web is an application that uses the Internet as an infrastructure. It has its own set of protocols:
- HTTP
- HTTPS
- DNS
- CORS

## HTTP

The **HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)** is the TCP/IP-based application layer communication protocol which standardizes how the client and server communicate with each other. It defines how the content is requested and transmitted across the internet.

## DNS

The **Domain Name System (DNS)** is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain names, like   `nytimes.com` or `espn.com`. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.

# HTTPS

HTTPS is a secure way to send data between a web server and a browser.

A communication through HTTPS starts with the handshake phase during which the server and the client agree on how to encrypt the communication, in particular they choose an encryption algorithm and a secret key. After the handshake all the communication between the server and the client will be encrypted using the agreed upon algorithm and key.

The handshake phase uses a particular kind of cryptography, called asymmetric cryptography, to communicate securely even though client and server have not yet agreed on a secret key. After the handshake phase the HTTPS communication is encrypted with symmetric cryptography, which is much more efficient but requires client and server to both have knowledge of the secret key.

## CORS

**Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)** is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading resources.
