# Router

A **router** is a networking device responsible for forwarding data packets between computer networks.

Routers find the most efficient path for the data to travels across networks, ensuring that communication is fast and reliable. They act as traffic coordinators, choosing the best possible path for data transmission.

Routers are a fundamental part of the Internet: they establish and maintain connections between the different networks and devices that constitute the Internet.

## Functions

- **Routing Decisions**: Routers analyze incoming data packets and make decisions on which path to forward the data based on destination (IP addresses) and network conditions.

- **Connecting Networks**: Routers are essential in connecting different networks together. They enable communication between your home network and the broader internet, as well as between different networks within an organization.

- **Managing Traffic**: Routers manage the flow of data to ensure optimal performance and avoid network congestion. They can prioritize certain types of data, such as video streaming, to ensure a better user experience.

## Types

<!-- TODO: wire, ethernet, wired connection -->
- **Wired Routers**: Utilize Ethernet cables to connect devices to the network. They typically come with multiple ethernet ports for devices such as computers, gaming consoles, and smart TVs.

<!-- TODO: wireless, wi-fi -->
- **Wireless Routers**: Provide network access without needing physical cables. They use Wi-Fi to transmit data between devices and are the most common type of router found in homes and offices.

<!-- TODO: internet backbone, ISP -->
- **Core Routers**: Operate within the backbone of the internet, directing data packets between major networks (such as ISPs). These routers are high-performance devices capable of handling massive amounts of data traffic.

## Security

As routers are a critical gateway between your network and the Internet, it's essential to keep them secure. Some common router security practices include:

- **Changing default passwords and usernames:** Manufacturers often set simple default passwords, which can be easily guessed or discovered by attackers. It's important to set a strong, unique password for your router.

- **Regular firmware updates:** Router manufacturers release updates to address security vulnerabilities and improve performance. Keep your router's software up to date.

- **Disabling remote management:** Some routers have a feature that allows remote access, which can be exploited by hackers. If you don't need this feature, disable it.

- **Creating a guest network:** If your router supports it, create a separate network for guests to use. This isolates them from your primary network, ensuring that they cannot access your devices or data.
