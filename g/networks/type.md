# Network Types

There are various types of networks based on the distance they cover, and the number of devices they connect. A few common network types are:

- **Personal Area Network (PAN)**: Connects devices within an individual workspace, typically within a range of 10 meters.
- **Local Area Network (LAN)**: Covers a small geographical area, such as a home or office, connecting multiple computers and other devices.
- **Wide Area Network (WAN)**: Covers a larger geographical area, interconnecting different LANs, often using leased telecommunication lines or wireless links.
- **Virtual Private Network (VPN)**: A secure network established over the public internet, encrypting the data transferred and restricting access to authorized users only.
