# IP Addresses

An IP address is a unique identifier assigned to every device in a network. There are two types of IP addresses:

- **IPv4**: Uses a 32-bit addressing system, allowing for approximately 4.3 billion unique IP addresses.
- **IPv6**: Uses a 128-bit addressing system, providing a significantly larger number of available IP addresses.

IP addresses can also be categorized as dynamic or static, depending on whether they change over time or remain constant for a device.
