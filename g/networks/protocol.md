# Network Protocols

Protocols are sets of rules that govern the communication between devices within a network. Some of the most common protocols include:

- **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP):** Ensures the reliable transmission of data and establishes connections between devices.
- **Internet Protocol (IP):** Facilitates the transmission of data packets, assigning unique IP addresses to identify devices.
- **User Datagram Protocol (UDP):** A lightweight, fast, but less reliable protocol compared to TCP, often used for streaming and gaming applications.
- **Transport Layer Security (TLS):** Cryptographic control of communication.

**Web protocols:**
- **HTTP:** Client-server communication on the web.
- **DNS:** Translates IP addresses to human-readable domain names.

## IP

## UDP

## TLS

TLS (Transport Layer Security) is a cryptographic protocol that provides privacy and data integrity between two communicating applications. It is widely used to secure HTTP, although it can be used with any protocol.

TLS is often used in combination with **HTTPS**, which is HTTP over TLS.

## HTTP

The **HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)** is the TCP/IP-based application layer communication protocol which standardizes how the client and server communicate with each other. It defines how the content is requested and transmitted across the internet.

## DNS

The **Domain Name System (DNS)** is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain names, like   `nytimes.com` or `espn.com`. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.
