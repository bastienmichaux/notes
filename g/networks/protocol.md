# Network Protocols

Protocols are sets of rules that govern the communication between devices within a network. Some of the most common protocols include:

- **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)**: Ensures the reliable transmission of data and establishes connections between devices.
- **Internet Protocol (IP)**: Facilitates the transmission of data packets, assigning unique IP addresses to identify devices.
- **User Datagram Protocol (UDP)**: A lightweight, fast, but less reliable protocol compared to TCP, often used for streaming and gaming applications.
