# Networking Devices

Several devices enable and facilitate communication between different devices. Common networking devices include:

- **Hubs**: Devices that connect different devices together, transmitting data packets to all devices on the network.
- **[Switches](./device.switch.md)**: Similar to hubs, but transmit data packets only to specific devices instead of broadcasting to all.
- **[Routers](./device.router.md)**: Devices that direct data packets between networks and provide the best path for data packets to reach their destination.
- **Firewalls**: Devices or software that monitor and filter incoming and outgoing network traffic, allowing only authorized data to pass through.
