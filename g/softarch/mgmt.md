# Project Management

A project is a temporary endeavor to create a unique product, service, or result:
- It is temporary because it has a defined beginning and end time.
- It is unique because it has a particular set of operations designed to accomplish a goal.

The main objective is to achieve project goals and targets while keeping in mind scope, time, quality, and cost. It defines the project workflow and team collaboration.

Popular project management apps include Jira, Assembla, YouTrack or Trello.
