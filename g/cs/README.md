# Computer Science Notes

**Note:** This section is freely inspired from the [Computer Science Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/computer-science) from [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh).

To understand Computer Science concepts, it's advised to program in C++ or C, since they force you to deal with pointers and memory allocation/deallocation. A lot of CS-specialized resources also refer to C/C++.
