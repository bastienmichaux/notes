# Computer Science: Algorithms

**What is an algorithm?**

An algorithm is a step-by-step set of instructions that tells a computer how to solve a problem or accomplish a task. They can be thought of as problem-solving "recipes".

An algorithm takes inputs (usually named "parameters" or "arguments") and produces an output: it `return` a value or data structure.

An algorithm should be:
- **clear and unambigous:** each step must be well-defined and leave no room for interpretation
- **finite:** it must terminate after a finite number of steps
- **deterministic:** the steps are executed in a specific order, ensuring that the same inputs will always produce the same outputs
- **effective:** it can be executed using finite resources within a reasonable amount of time, effectiveness is described using [asymptotic notation](#asymptotic-notation), the time taken is called [runtime](#runtime)
- **specific:** it should solve a single, specific problem, so that when solving larger problems we can re-use existing algorithms

Algorithms get their name from the 9th-century Persian polymath [Al-Khwarizmi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_ibn_Musa_al-Khwarizmi).

Here are some common algorithms that you should know:
- Sorting
- Recursion
- Searching
- Cache
- Tree
- Graph
- Greedy
- Backtracking
- Substring Search
- Suffix arrays
- Dynamic programming
