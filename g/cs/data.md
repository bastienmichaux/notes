# Representing Data

Computers only understand 0 and 1s, so computer science is built on representing any kind of data (numbers, text, audio, video, etc) as series of 0s and 1s.

**Units of information:**
- **bit:** smallest unit, is either 0 or 1
- **nibble:** 4 bits (0 to 15)
- **octet:** or byte, 8 bits (0 to 255)
- **word:** unit of data used by a particular computer architecture, typically ranging from 8 to 64 bits.
- **double word:** twice the size of a word, commonly 32 bits.
- **quad word:** four times the size of a word, usually 64 bits.
