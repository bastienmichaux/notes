# Representing Data

Computers only understand 0 and 1s, so computer science is built on representing any kind of data (numbers, text, audio, video, etc) as series of 0s and 1s.

**Units of information (by size):**
- **bit:** smallest unit, is either 0 or 1
- **nibble:** 4 bits (0 to 15)
- **octet:** or byte, 8 bits (0 to 255)
- **word:** unit of data used by a particular computer architecture, typically ranging from 8 to 64 bits.
- **double word:** twice the size of a word, commonly 32 bits.
- **quad word:** four times the size of a word, usually 64 bits.

**Units of information (by type):**
- **boolean:** a value that is either true or false; usually true = 1, false = 0
- **int:** an integer number such as 1, 2, 3...
- **float:** a decimal number such as Pi (3.14) or 10/3
- **char:** a character: an integer interpreted as a letter
- **address:** a location in memory (RAM)

## Bitwise operators

Bitwise operators are used to perform operations on individual bits of a number. They are used in cryptography, image processing, and other applications.
