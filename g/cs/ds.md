# Computer Science: Data Structures

A data structure is a way of organizing data for efficient use. Some common data structures include:
- [Array](./ds.array.md)
- [Linked list](./ds.linked-list.md)
- [Stack](./ds.stack.md)
- [Queue](./ds.queue.md)
- [Hash table](./ds.hash-table.md)
- [Tree](./ds.tree.md)
- [Heap](./ds.heap.md)
- [Graph](./ds.graph.md)

Data structures are also known as **collections**.

All data structures are made of one or more **elements**. An element is an atomic (non-divisible) part of the structure.

A **node** is just another name for a data structure element. The name comes from real-life nets (such as fishing nets), which are made of connected elements (fibers). A network is a set of connected nodes.

When you implement a data structure, care for:
- **correctness:** implement the interface correctly
- **time complexity:** time length of operations should be as small as possible
- **space complexity:** memory usage should be as small as possible
