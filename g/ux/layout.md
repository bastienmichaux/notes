# Layout

## White space
white space aka empty/blank/negative spaces, designates the the space between elements, usually has a single color, usually white. It gives contrast and structure to the elements of the document.

A great exemple of whitespace use is Google's homepage. The blank space makes the user focus on what is important : search.

tips :
* make a layout that is easy on the eyes
* show only what is truly important, focus on content
* use whitespace between paragraphs and in the left and right margins to increase comprehension
* whitespace is more efficient with highlighted items. highlighted items with no whitespace are less recalled by users

don't :
sacrifice whitespace because you think users don't scroll
users do scroll, don't cramp the top of the page

Grouping of elements
color, shared background and co-location are more effective

outlines are less effective
