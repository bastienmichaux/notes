# Testing

Testing is a process where test cases are given/performed to:
- the program under testing
- a test oracle (testing tool or framework)

The output of the program and the oracle are compared to determine if the program behaves correctly.

## Oracle

A test oracle is a program that checks the correctness of another program for a test case. It's called an oracle because it informs us whether the targeted software works as intended or not. There are many tools and softwares that can act as test oracles, they all have different features and limitations.

## Tips

Two different failures should end up in two different bug reports.

Do follow up testing to see if you can find a more serious problem.
