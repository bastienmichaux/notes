# Testing

Testing is a process where test cases are given to:
- the program under testing
- a test oracle (testing tool or framework)

The output of the program and the oracle are compared to determine if the program behaves correctly.

## Oracle

A test oracle is a program that checks the correctness of another program for a test case. It's called oracle because it informs us whether the targeted software works as intended or not.

## Techniques

There are many different testing techniques. They sometimes overlap: the same test can be used for different testing techniques.
