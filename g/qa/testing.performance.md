# Performance Testing

Performance Testing evaluates a system’s behavior under various extreme conditions.

The main intent of performance testing is monitoring and improving key performance indicators such as response time, throughput, memory, CPU use, and more.

**Three S:** There are three important metrics to observe and evaluate:
- Speed
- Scalability
- Stability


## Types

Here are the most common performance tests:
- [Load Testing](./testing.load.md)
- [Stress Testing](./testing.stress.md)
- Spike Testing
- Endurance Testing
- Volume Testing
- Scalability Testing
