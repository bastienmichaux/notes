# Test Plan

A Test Plan is a master document that describes and justifies:
- test strategy
- test objectives
- schedule
- estimation
- deliverables
- resources

The Test Plan for a product is the reference for all test types and activities. The Test Plan helps us determine the effort needed to validate the quality of the application under test.
