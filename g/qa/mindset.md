# Tester Mindset

Look for the weak spots in a product, whatever that product may be, and report them back, so that they can be fixed. This way, the product can be of the highest achievable quality.

The tester should think in the most **destructive** way possible and be as **creative** as possible.

A few important points:

- Know the product you are testing
- Research the domain of the product (the real-world things it relates to)
- Think outside of the box when you are testing it
- Misuse the product as much as possible.
