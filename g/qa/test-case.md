# Test Case

A Test Case is a set of actions executed to verify a particular feature or functionality, it usually:
- test steps
- test data
- preconditions
- postcondition 

Using the case, the tester compares expected and actual results to validate the functionality.

A test case is developed for a specific [test scenario](./test-scenario). Test Cases are more granular than Test Scenarios: a Test Scenario is a set of Test Cases.
