# Defect Reporting

Reporting is essential to inform all parties involved about the current quality. Reporting influences the decisions that stakeholders/managers make.

Ideally, reporting can be accessed by everyone in the development team, and is versioned.

Defects can be grouped by environment, feature, module, team, platform, etc. This allows filtering issues and tracking their management.
