# Functional Testing

Functional testing is a type of testing that validates the software system against the functional requirements/specifications.

The purpose of functional tests is to test each software feature by providing appropriate input and verifying the output against the Functional requirements.

Non-functional testing doesn't verify features, it verifies performance, reliability, loads, etc.

## Types

Functional tests arranged roughly by priority:
1. Unit Testing: verify software units (classes, functions/methods), typically written by developers.
1. Integration Testing: verify interaction between software components (modules, components, libraries).
1. Smoke Testing: minimal tests verifying a build after deployment in a new environment.
1. Sanity Testing: validate new features, bug fixes.
1. Regression Testing: verify that changes haven't introduced new defects.
1. User-acceptance Testing: performed by users/clients to validate the product.
1. Exploratory Testing: explore, deepen quality by using the software in all the wrong possible ways.
1. Compatibility Testing: validates the software on all supported platforms, browsers, OS, etc.
