# Smoke Testing

Smoke Testing consists of a minimal set of tests, it's performed when there is a new deployment in a target enviroment (alpha, beta, production, etc).

Smoke Tests come first: they determine that the deployed build is stable in the target environment. It confirms that testers can proceed with further software testing.

Exploratory testing is a functional test.

Smoke Testing vs Sanity Testing: a smoke test verifies the environment while a sanity test verifies the build.
