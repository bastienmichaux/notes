# Bug Reporting

Bug reporting is essential to inform all parties involved about the current quality. Reporting influences the decisions that stakeholders/managers make.

Ideally, reporting can be accessed by everyone in the development team, and is versioned.

Bug can be grouped by environment, feature, module, team, platform, etc. This allows filtering issues and tracking their management.

A bug report should have the following:
- title
- description
- reproduction steps
- module, environment

Additionally, this may help:
- screenshots
- tag(s)
- testing session

## Bug Report Components

### Title

**(component/module/app): (error) when (protocol):**
- If relevant, prefix the title with the root component
- Describe the failure first
- Then describe when the failure happens

Examples:
- "Customer View: Error when adding a new user"
- "Shopping Cart: Number of items not displayed on Safari"

Don’t just say “Something’s wrong with feature-name".


### Description

A bug description may include 3 parts:
- introduction: expand on the title
- reproduction steps: how to reproduce the issue
- impact: how the issue affects stakeholders (importance)

Be clear, concise, neutral. Write dispassionately.

Include enough information to get the bug fixed. Think about the developers.

How to reproduce: include the shortest number of steps to reproduce it.


Maximize: 
Generalize: say how the problem affects stakeholders, . 
- Externalize: focus not  to how it will affect stakeholders and show how it will affect them.
- Neutral: write clearly and dispassionately, always use a neutral tone. 

## Bug Tracking



## Tips

If you can fix the bug yourself, it’s probably easiest to do so.

You don't always need to write a bug report: for minor issues you can mention it.
