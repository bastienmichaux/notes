# Testing Approaches

When approaching testing for a project, there are 2 techniques:
- **Proactive:** An approach in which the test design process is initiated as early as possible in order to find and fix the defects before the build is created.
- **Reactive:** An approach in which the testing is not started until after design and coding are completed.

Three approaches are commonly used to test a product:
- Black Box Testing
- White Box Testing: code is visible to testers
- Gray Box Testing: partial knowledge of the software internals

## White Box Testing

White Box Testing means that code is visible to testers.

It is also called Clear box testing, Open box testing, Transparent box testing, Code-based testing, and Glass box testing.

## Gray Box Testing

Gray Box Testing means that only some parts of the code are visible to testers. The goal is to search and identify the defects due to improper code structure or improper use of applications.

## Black Box Testing

Black Box Testing is a software testing method in which the functionalities of software applications are tested without having knowledge of internal code structure, implementation details and internal paths.

It mainly focuses on input and output of software applications and it is entirely based on software requirements and specifications.

It is also known as Behavioral Testing.
