# Sanity Testing

Sanity testing is performed after receiving a software build, with minor changes in code, or functionality, to ascertain that the bugs have been fixed and no further issues are introduced due to these changes. The goal is to determine that the proposed functionality works roughly as expected. If sanity test fails, the build is rejected to save the time and costs involved in a more rigorous testing.

Exploratory testing is a functional test.

Sanity Testing vs Smoke Testing: a smoke test validates the environment, a sanity test validates the build itself.
