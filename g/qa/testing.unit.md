# Unit Testing

Unit testing is where individual **units of software** (modules, functions/methods, routines, etc.) are tested to ensure their correctness. This low-level testing ensures smaller components are functionally sound while taking the burden off of higher-level tests. Unit testing is the basis for larger integration tests.

Generally, a developer writes these tests during the development process and they are run as automated tests.

Exploratory testing is a functional test.
