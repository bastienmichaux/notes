# Email Testing

Email Testing validates emails before sending it out to your subscribers to verify links, design, spelling, and more.

Email Testing combines functional testing (validating requirements) and non-functional testing (security, load).

**Tools:**
- Gmail Tester: Node.js tool
- Mailinator: website providing temporary email addresses
