# Load Testing

Load Testing verifies performance under real-life-based load conditions. The goal is to verify that the software supports at least as many users as intended.

Behaviors studied include response time, throughput, pass/fail transactions.

Load Testing is a subtype of Performance Testing.

Example of a load test: on an online shop, the cart checkout response time is less or equal to 500 milliseconds under typical business hours.
