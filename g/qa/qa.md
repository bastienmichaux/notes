# Quality Assurance

**Quality** in software development means fulfilling the requirements and expectations of the stakeholders: users and/or clients.

Software quality depends on many aspects:
- accessibility, ease of use
- availability, dependability, reliability
- performance
- price
- security, privacy
- usefulness, functionality

**Assurance** means guaranteeing that the software exhibits quality. Various techniques can be used. It offers a warranty that the product has (almost) no defects and works as intended.

Assurance is very important because software defects mean loss of users, money, reputation, and sometimes even injury or death.

**Quality Assurance** focuses on improving the software development process. It means ensuring that an organization provides the best service.

**QA vs Testing:** QA is more than software quality and testing: it also comprises evaluating and improving all the development processes: management of requirements design, development, testing, release. QA is involved at all steps of the **SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)**.
