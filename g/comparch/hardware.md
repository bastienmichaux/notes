# Computer Hardware Components

Hardware components are the physical parts that make up a computer system:
1. [Motherboard](#motherboard)
1. [Central Processing Unit (CPU)](#cpu)
1. [Memory (RAM)](#memory)
1. [Storage (HDD)](#storage)
1. [Input/Output Devices](#io)
1. [Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)](#graphics-processing-unit)


## Motherboard

The motherboard is the main circuit board of the computer. It connects all other hardware components and allows components to communicate with each other. It provides a central hub for communication between the CPU, memory, and other hardware components.


## CPU

The CPU serves as the heart and brain of a computer. It performs all the processing inside the computer and is responsible for executing programs, performing calculations, and managing the flow of data.


## Memory

Random Access Memory (RAM) is where data is temporarily stored while the computer is powered on (it's volatile memory). The data is constantly accessed, written, and rewritten by the CPU. The more RAM a system has, the more tasks it can process simultaneously. The RAM is cleared off when the computer is shut down.


## Storage

Storage devices like hard disk drives (HDD) or solid-state drives (SSD) are used to store data permanently on the computer, even when the device is powered off. Operating systems, software, and user files are stored on these drives.


## IO

Input/Output (IO) Devices, (mouse, keyboard, screen, etc) are used to interact with the computer. Input devices allow users to interact with the computer. Output devices present information to the user.


## Graphics Processing Unit

The Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is responsible for rendering images, videos, and animations on the computer screen. Its main function is to handle and display graphics, making your visuals smooth and responsive. Important for graphics processing (gaming, video, image editing).


## Power Supply Unit

The power supply unit (PSU) provides the necessary power to all components in the computer. It converts AC power to the DC power that the computerâ€™s components require.
