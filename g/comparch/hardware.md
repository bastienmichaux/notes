# Computer Hardware Components

Hardware components are the physical parts that make up a computer:
1. [Motherboard](#motherboard)
1. [Central Processing Unit (CPU)](#cpu)
1. [Memory (RAM)](#ram)
1. [Storage (HDD)](#storage)
1. [Input/Output Devices](#io)
1. [Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)](#graphics-processing-unit)

## [Motherboard](./motherboard.md)

The motherboard is the main circuit board of the computer. It connects all other hardware components and allows them to communicate with each other. It provides a central hub for communication between the CPU, memory, and other hardware components.


## [CPU](./cpu.md)

The CPU is the heart and brain of a computer. It performs all processes and calculations, is responsible for executing programs and managing the flow of data.


## RAM

Random Access Memory (RAM) is where data is temporarily stored while the computer is powered on: it is **volatile** memory. The data is constantly accessed, written, and rewritten by the CPU. The RAM is cleared off when the computer is shut down.

The more RAM a computer has, the more tasks it can process simultaneously.


## Storage

Storage devices like hard disk drives (HDD) or solid-state drives (SSD) are **permanent** memory: they store data permanently on the computer, even when the device is powered off. Operating systems, software, and user files are stored on these drives.

SSDs are faster, but are more expensive.


## IO

Input/Output (IO) Devices, (mouse, keyboard, screen, etc) are used to interact with the computer. Input devices allow users to interact with the computer. Output devices present information to the user.


## Graphics Processing Unit

The Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is responsible for rendering images, videos, and animations on the computer screen. Its main function is to handle and display graphics, making your visuals smooth and responsive. They're important for graphics processing (gaming, video, image editing).

Note: GPUs are an example of co-processors: they're specialized processors companion to the CPU.


## Power Supply Unit

The Power Supply Unit (PSU) provides the necessary power to all components in the computer. It converts domestic AC power to the DC power that the computerâ€™s components require.
