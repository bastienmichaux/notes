# Computer Hardware Components

Hardware components are the physical parts that make up a computer system:
1. [Motherboard](#motherboard)
1. [Central Processing Unit (CPU)](#cpu)
1. [Memory (RAM)](#memory)
1. [Storage (HDD)](#storage)
1. [Input/Output Devices](#io)
1. [Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)](#graphics-processing-unit)


## Motherboard

The motherboard is the main circuit board that connects all components of the computer. It provides a central hub for communication between the CPU, memory, and other hardware components.

Key Points:
- Connects all other hardware components.
- Allows components to communicate with each other.


## CPU

The CPU serves as the heart and brain of a computer. It performs all the processing inside the computer and is responsible for executing instructions, performing calculations, and managing the flow of data.

Key Points:
- Considered the “brain” of the computer.
- Performs all the major processes and calculations.


## Memory

Random Access Memory (RAM) is where data is temporarily stored while the computer is powered on. The data is constantly accessed, written, and rewritten by the CPU. The more RAM a system has, the more tasks it can process simultaneously.

Key Points:
- Temporary storage for data while the computer is on.
- More RAM allows for better multitasking.


## Storage

Storage devices like hard disk drives (HDD) or solid-state drives (SSD) are used to store data permanently on the computer, even when the device is powered off. Operating systems, software, and user files are stored on these drives.

Key Points:
- Permanent storage for data.
- Comes in HDD and SSD types, with SSDs being faster but more expensive.


## IO

Input/ (IO) Devices, such as a mouse, keyboard, or scanner, are used to interact with and input data into the computer. Output devices, like the display monitor and speakers, present information and data in a format we can understand.

Key Points:
- Input devices allow users to interact with the computer.
- Output devices present information to the user.


## Graphics Processing Unit

The Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is responsible for rendering images, videos, and animations on the computer screen. Its main function is to handle and display graphics, making your visuals smooth and responsive.

Key Points:
- Handles and processes graphics and visuals.
- Important for gaming, video editing, and graphic design tasks.


## Power Supply Unit

The power supply unit (PSU) provides the necessary power to all components in the computer. It converts the AC power from the wall socket into the DC power that the computer’s components require.

Key Points:
- Provides power to all computer components.
- Converts AC power to DC power.
