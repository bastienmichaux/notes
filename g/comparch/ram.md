# RAM

The primary memory of a computer is Random-Access Memory (RAM), it's the memory directly accessed by the processor. 

RAM is a volatile memory, meaning it exists when the systemâ€™s power is on, and it vanishes as the system is switched off. The primary memory contains the data required by the currently executing program in the CPU. The data not in primary memory, must be fetched from the secondary memory (Hard Drive).
