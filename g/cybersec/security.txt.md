# `security.txt`

`security.txt` is a file found on some websites that can be used by ethical hackers.

<!-- TODO: links -->
It's a cousin of `ads.txt`, `robots.txt` and `humans.txt`. It originated as a IETF RFC.

The file should have an Internet Media Type of `text/plain` and must be served over HTTPS. It should be in a `/.well-known` folder.

If you implement this file, be prepared to receive low-effort reports from script kiddies. Implement e-mail filters against spam.
