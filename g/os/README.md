# Operating Systems

An **Operating System** is a fundamental software that manages computer hardware resources such as:
- the central processing unit (CPU)
- computer memory
- file storage
- input/output (I/O) devices
- network connections

It's an interface between the user and the computer. It allows users to conveniently run programs, hiding much of the complexity related to low-level programming. An OS allows programs to communicate with the hardware by providing common services.
